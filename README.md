# LJMs_Portfolio

# DETAILS

I wanted to create this portfolio so that future employers are able to see all my work and my contact information,
in one place. I created this portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. The webpage has a navigation bar that when clicked
on will take you to certain sections of the page. I used some HTML effects to make some images and text move.

# WHAT I LEARNED
I learned a lot of new things by building this webpage such as, how to connect a certain part of the webpage to a navigation bar and how to make an image
go to another webpage when clicked on.
